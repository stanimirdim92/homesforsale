#### 9. **API Design (DRF Integration)**
   - **Endpoints**: 
     - `/register/`: For user registration.
     - `/login/`: JWT-based login endpoint.
     - `/profile/`: To get or update the user’s profile (based on their role).
     - `/listings/`: CRUD operations for managing property listings (only accessible by sellers/agents).
     - `/inquiries/`: To send or view property inquiries (available to buyers and sellers).
   - **Pagination & Filtering**: Implement pagination and filtering for properties. For example, filter properties by price, location, property type, etc.
   - **Throttling**: Use DRF’s throttling to protect API endpoints from abuse (e.g., too many login attempts).

#### 10. **Property Reviews and Ratings**
   - **User Reviews for Agents and Sellers**: Allow buyers to leave reviews and ratings for agents or sellers they’ve worked with, contributing to the platform’s credibility.
   - **Property Reviews**: Enable reviews or feedback for specific properties, which other potential buyers can see before making inquiries.

#### 11. **Scalability & Performance Optimizations**
   - **Caching**: Use Django’s caching framework (e.g., Redis) to cache frequently accessed data, like property listings, to reduce database load.
   - **Task Queue**: Use Celery for background tasks like sending emails (e.g., confirmation emails, alerts for new property listings).
   - **Load Balancing**: For high-traffic real estate platforms, set up load balancing across multiple servers to distribute the traffic evenly.
   - **Asynchronous Requests**: Use Django Channels for real-time updates like chat systems between buyers and agents or live property notifications.
   - **Caching**: Use caching for commonly accessed data like user sessions to improve performance.
   - **API Rate Limiting**: Protect the system from abuse by rate-limiting API calls, especially during authentication processes.

#### 12. **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**
   - **SEO-Friendly URLs**: Ensure that property URLs are user-friendly and descriptive (e.g., `/properties/amsterdam-beautiful-apartment-for-sale/`).
   - **Sitemap and Metadata**: Generate a dynamic sitemap and metadata for property pages to make them discoverable by search engines.
   - **Structured Data**: Use JSON-LD to provide structured data about the properties to search engines, improving visibility.

#### 13. **Admin Panel for Platform Management**
   - **User Management**: Admins can view all users, reset passwords, deactivate users, and more.
   - **Property Moderation**: Admins can approve, edit, or remove property listings to maintain the quality and legality of listings.
   - **Analytics Dashboard**: Provide admins with detailed reports on platform usage, new registrations, active listings, and user engagement.

   - **Verification Emails**: Sent after registration for email verification.
   - **Security Alerts**: Notify users of login attempts, password changes, or suspicious activity.
   - **Promotional/Informational**: Depending on user preferences, allow users to subscribe to updates or newsletters.


### Django and DRF Code Example for a Custom User Model:

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractBaseUser, BaseUserManager, PermissionsMixin
from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _
from django.db import models

class CustomUserManager(BaseUserManager):
    def create_user(self, email, password=None, **extra_fields):
        if not email:
            raise ValueError(_('The Email field must be set'))
        email = self.normalize_email(email)
        user = self.model(email=email, **extra_fields)
        user.set_password(password)
        user.save(using=self._db)
        return user

    def create_superuser(self, email, password=None, **extra_fields):
        extra_fields.setdefault('is_staff', True)
        extra_fields.setdefault('is_superuser', True)

        return self.create_user(email, password, **extra_fields)

class CustomUser(AbstractBaseUser, PermissionsMixin):
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
    full_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    phone_number = models.CharField(max_length=15, blank=True)
    language_preference = models.CharField(max_length=10, default='en')
    currency_preference = models.CharField(max_length=3, default='EUR')
    gdpr_consent = models.BooleanField
