Designing a user account system involves creating a structure that handles user authentication, authorization, data management, and security. Below is an outline of the key components and features for a user account system design:

### Core Considerations for European Real Estate Platforms
1. **GDPR Compliance**: Since you're targeting a European audience, strict GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) compliance is essential. This means implementing privacy features like data protection, consent management, right to erasure, and data access.
   
2. **Multi-Language Support**: Many European countries use different languages, so the platform should support multiple languages to cater to a diverse user base.

3. **Localization (Currency, Timezones)**: European real estate platforms must handle different currencies (EUR, GBP, etc.) and timezones depending on the region. User profiles should reflect this.

4. **User Roles and Types**: Real estate platforms typically serve multiple types of users (property buyers, sellers, agents, etc.). Therefore, different user roles and access levels should be implemented.

### Extended Design for Real Estate User Accounts in Django with DRF

#### 1. **Extended User Model**
   - **Custom User Model**: In Django, create a custom `User` model extending `AbstractUser` to manage users' unique needs for the platform (property buyers, sellers, real estate agents).
   - **Fields**:
     - [x] Email 
     - Password (with hashing via Django's built-in utilities)
     - **Password Recovery**: Implement a "Forgot Password" feature that allows users to reset their password through a password reset link sent to their email.
     - **Password Change**: Allow users to change their password within the account settings after logging in.
     - Phone Number (optional but useful for real estate inquiries)
     - Address: Useful for agents or property owners.
     - Currency Preferences: EUR, GBP, etc. - Default English or based on country
       - Currency Settings: Add support for currency conversion to display prices in users' local currencies using an API (e.g., fixer.io for real-time conversion rates).
     - Preferred Language: French, German, Spanish, etc. - Default English or based on country
     - **GDPR Consent**: Boolean field to track if users have consented to the platform’s data policies.
     - Profile picture and bio
     - [x] Full name, short name
     - **Validation**: Validate email format, password strength, and unique email. Phone must be unique?
     - **Email Verification**: Send a verification email with a unique link/token to confirm the user's email address.

#### 2. **User Types & Roles**
   - **User Roles**: Define roles such as:
     - **Buyer** / **Seller**: Can browse properties, favorite them, and contact sellers/agents.
     - **Seller**: Can list properties, view inquiries, and communicate with potential buyers.
     - **Agent**: Acts on behalf of multiple sellers or buyers. Can list properties, update property details, and negotiate on behalf of users.
     - **Admin**: Full control over platform, property listings, user management, and system-wide settings.
   - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
     - Assign different roles to users, such as "Admin," "User," "Moderator," etc.
     - Roles determine what users can access or modify within the system.
   - **Permissions**: Use Django’s built-in `permissions` system to define what actions each role can perform (e.g., sellers can add properties, buyers can only inquire or favorite listings).

#### 3. **Registration & Profile Management**
   - **Multi-Step Registration**: Include fields based on user type. For example:
     - Buyers may only need basic info (email, password, phone number).
     - Sellers/agents may need more detailed profiles (company name, address, proof of identity, license if required in certain countries).
   - **Email Verification**: After registration, send a verification link to the user's email, with expiration functionality to comply with security best practices.
   - **Profile Completion**: Guide users through a profile completion process, ensuring they fill in all relevant fields for the real estate market (especially sellers and agents).
   - **Login**: 
     - Username/Email and password.
     - Use hashed and salted passwords to ensure security.
     - Captcha (if enabled).
   - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: 
     - Optionally, require users to provide a secondary authentication factor, such as SMS or an authentication app code.
   - **Social Login**: Allow login via third-party services like Google, Facebook, etc. using OAuth.
   - **Session Management**:
     - Implement tokens (e.g., JWT) or session cookies to keep users logged in.
     - Define session timeouts and auto-logout for security.
   - **Account Deletion/Deactivation**: Users should have the option to deactivate or permanently delete their account.
   - **User Activity Logs**: Track important user actions (login, account changes, etc.) for security and analytics.
   - **Admin Panel**: Allow administrators to view and manage users, with options for banning or resetting user accounts.


#### 4. **Localization & Multi-Language Support**
   - **Internationalization (i18n)**: Use Django’s `gettext` functions to support translation. You’ll need to ensure that forms, error messages, and any communication are available in the user's preferred language.
   - **Date/Time Preferences**: Store users’ preferred timezones so that property viewing times, scheduled meetings, or email alerts are localized to their timezone.

#### 5. **Enhanced Security Features**
   - **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Allow users to add an extra layer of security through 2FA, using SMS, email, or authentication apps like Google Authenticator.
   - **IP Whitelisting**: Especially useful for admins or agents. Limit access to specific functionalities (like property listing management) to known IP addresses.
   - **Security Alerts**: Notify users via email/SMS of any suspicious activity, such as logins from a new device or location.
   - **Account Lockout**: Implement account lockout or CAPTCHA after several failed login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.
   
#### 6. **Advanced GDPR Compliance**
   - **Right to Access and Deletion**: Provide a feature where users can request access to their data or request deletion of their account.
   - **Data Anonymization**: When users request deletion, rather than removing all data outright, anonymize key details to maintain analytics and records while complying with GDPR.
   - **Consent Management**: Track and record consent from users for data processing, marketing emails, and other uses.
   - **Cookie Policies**: Integrate a cookie consent banner where users must agree to tracking or analytical cookies.

#### 7. **Property Listings Management for Sellers and Agents**
   - **Listing Creation and Management**: 
     - Allow sellers and agents to create property listings with fields for location, property type, price, description, images, and more.
     - Enable users to update or remove their listings.
   - **Property Analytics**: Provide analytics on views, inquiries, and engagements with their property listings to sellers/agents.
   - **Notifications**: Notify sellers/agents when potential buyers express interest or schedule a viewing.

#### 8. **Favorite Listings and Inquiries for Buyers**
   - **Favorites**: Allow buyers to favorite properties they are interested in, storing them in their profile for later viewing.
   - **Inquiries**: Buyers can send inquiries to sellers or agents directly through the platform. These interactions should be saved in the user's account for future reference.
   - **Property Alerts**: Allow buyers to set alerts for new properties matching their criteria (price range, location, property type).

#### 9. **API Design (DRF Integration)**
   - **Endpoints**: 
     - `/register/`: For user registration.
     - `/login/`: JWT-based login endpoint.
     - `/profile/`: To get or update the user’s profile (based on their role).
     - `/listings/`: CRUD operations for managing property listings (only accessible by sellers/agents).
     - `/inquiries/`: To send or view property inquiries (available to buyers and sellers).
   - **Pagination & Filtering**: Implement pagination and filtering for properties. For example, filter properties by price, location, property type, etc.
   - **Throttling**: Use DRF’s throttling to protect API endpoints from abuse (e.g., too many login attempts).

#### 10. **Property Reviews and Ratings**
   - **User Reviews for Agents and Sellers**: Allow buyers to leave reviews and ratings for agents or sellers they’ve worked with, contributing to the platform’s credibility.
   - **Property Reviews**: Enable reviews or feedback for specific properties, which other potential buyers can see before making inquiries.

#### 11. **Scalability & Performance Optimizations**
   - **Caching**: Use Django’s caching framework (e.g., Redis) to cache frequently accessed data, like property listings, to reduce database load.
   - **Task Queue**: Use Celery for background tasks like sending emails (e.g., confirmation emails, alerts for new property listings).
   - **Load Balancing**: For high-traffic real estate platforms, set up load balancing across multiple servers to distribute the traffic evenly.
   - **Asynchronous Requests**: Use Django Channels for real-time updates like chat systems between buyers and agents or live property notifications.
   - **Caching**: Use caching for commonly accessed data like user sessions to improve performance.
   - **API Rate Limiting**: Protect the system from abuse by rate-limiting API calls, especially during authentication processes.

#### 12. **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**
   - **SEO-Friendly URLs**: Ensure that property URLs are user-friendly and descriptive (e.g., `/properties/amsterdam-beautiful-apartment-for-sale/`).
   - **Sitemap and Metadata**: Generate a dynamic sitemap and metadata for property pages to make them discoverable by search engines.
   - **Structured Data**: Use JSON-LD to provide structured data about the properties to search engines, improving visibility.

#### 13. **Admin Panel for Platform Management**
   - **User Management**: Admins can view all users, reset passwords, deactivate users, and more.
   - **Property Moderation**: Admins can approve, edit, or remove property listings to maintain the quality and legality of listings.
   - **Analytics Dashboard**: Provide admins with detailed reports on platform usage, new registrations, active listings, and user engagement.

   - **Verification Emails**: Sent after registration for email verification.
   - **Security Alerts**: Notify users of login attempts, password changes, or suspicious activity.
   - **Promotional/Informational**: Depending on user preferences, allow users to subscribe to updates or newsletters.


### Django and DRF Code Example for a Custom User Model:

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractBaseUser, BaseUserManager, PermissionsMixin
from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _
from django.db import models

class CustomUserManager(BaseUserManager):
    def create_user(self, email, password=None, **extra_fields):
        if not email:
            raise ValueError(_('The Email field must be set'))
        email = self.normalize_email(email)
        user = self.model(email=email, **extra_fields)
        user.set_password(password)
        user.save(using=self._db)
        return user

    def create_superuser(self, email, password=None, **extra_fields):
        extra_fields.setdefault('is_staff', True)
        extra_fields.setdefault('is_superuser', True)

        return self.create_user(email, password, **extra_fields)

class CustomUser(AbstractBaseUser, PermissionsMixin):
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
    full_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    phone_number = models.CharField(max_length=15, blank=True)
    language_preference = models.CharField(max_length=10, default='en')
    currency_preference = models.CharField(max_length=3, default='EUR')
    gdpr_consent = models.BooleanField
