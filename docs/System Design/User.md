Designing a user account system involves creating a structure that handles user authentication, authorization, data management, and security. Below is an outline of the key components and features for a user account system design:

### Core Considerations for European Real Estate Platforms
1. **GDPR Compliance**: Since you're targeting a European audience, strict GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) compliance is essential. This means implementing privacy features like data protection, consent management, right to erasure, and data access.
   
2. **Multi-Language Support**: Many European countries use different languages, so the platform should support multiple languages to cater to a diverse user base.

3. **Localization (Currency, Timezones)**: European real estate platforms must handle different currencies (EUR, GBP, etc.) and timezones depending on the region. User profiles should reflect this.

4. **User Roles and Types**: Real estate platforms typically serve multiple types of users (property buyers, sellers, agents, etc.). Therefore, different user roles and access levels should be implemented.

### Extended Design for Real Estate User Accounts in Django with DRF

#### 1. **Extended User Model**
   - **Custom User Model**: In Django, create a custom `User` model extending `AbstractUser` to manage users' unique needs for the platform (property buyers, sellers, real estate agents).
   - **Fields**:
     - [x] Email 
     - [x] Password (with hashing via Django's built-in utilities)
     - **Password Recovery**: Implement a "Forgot Password" feature that allows users to reset their password through a password reset link sent to their email.
     - **Password Change**: Allow users to change their password within the account settings after logging in.
     - [x] Phone Number (optional but useful for real estate inquiries)
     - [x] Address: Useful for agents or property owners.
     - [x] Currency Preferences: EUR, GBP, etc. - Default English or based on country
       - Currency Settings: Add support for currency conversion to display prices in users' local currencies using an API (e.g., fixer.io for real-time conversion rates).
     - [x] Preferred Language: French, German, Spanish, etc. - Default English or based on country
     - **GDPR Consent**: Boolean field to track if users have consented to the platform’s data policies.
     - Profile picture and bio
     - [x] Full name, short name
     - [x] **Validation**: Validate email format, password strength, and unique email. Phone must be unique?
     - **Email Verification**: Send a verification email with a unique link/token to confirm the user's email address.

#### 2. **User Types & Roles**
   - **User Roles**: Define roles such as:
     - **Buyer** / **Seller**: Can browse properties, favorite them, and contact sellers/agents.
     - **Seller**: Can list properties, view inquiries, and communicate with potential buyers.
     - **Agent**: Acts on behalf of multiple sellers or buyers. Can list properties, update property details, and negotiate on behalf of users.
     - **Admin**: Full control over platform, property listings, user management, and system-wide settings.
   - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
     - Assign different roles to users, such as "Admin," "User," "Moderator," etc.
     - Roles determine what users can access or modify within the system.
   - **Permissions**: Use Django’s built-in `permissions` system to define what actions each role can perform (e.g., sellers can add properties, buyers can only inquire or favorite listings).

#### 3. **Registration & Profile Management**
   - **Multi-Step Registration**: Include fields based on user type. For example:
     - Buyers may only need basic info (email, password, phone number).
     - Sellers/agents may need more detailed profiles (company name, address, proof of identity, license if required in certain countries).
   - **Email Verification**: After registration, send a verification link to the user's email, with expiration functionality to comply with security best practices.
   - **Profile Completion**: Guide users through a profile completion process, ensuring they fill in all relevant fields for the real estate market (especially sellers and agents).
   - **Login**: 
     - [x] Username/Email and password.
     - [x] Use hashed and salted passwords to ensure security.
     - Captcha (if enabled).
   - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: 
     - Optionally, require users to provide a secondary authentication factor, such as SMS or an authentication app code.
   - **Social Login**: Allow login via third-party services like Google, Facebook, etc. using OAuth.
   - **Session Management**:
     - Implement tokens (e.g., JWT) or session cookies to keep users logged in.
     - Define session timeouts and auto-logout for security.
   - **Account Deletion/Deactivation**: Users should have the option to deactivate or permanently delete their account.
   - **User Activity Logs**: Track important user actions (login, account changes, etc.) for security and analytics.
   - **Admin Panel**: Allow administrators to view and manage users, with options for banning or resetting user accounts.


#### 4. **Localization & Multi-Language Support**
   - [x] **Internationalization (i18n)**: Use Django’s `gettext` functions to support translation. You’ll need to ensure that forms, error messages, and any communication are available in the user's preferred language.
   - [x] **Date/Time Preferences**: Store users’ preferred timezones so that property viewing times, scheduled meetings, or email alerts are localized to their timezone.

#### 5. **Enhanced Security Features**
   - **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Allow users to add an extra layer of security through 2FA, using SMS, email, or authentication apps like Google Authenticator.
   - **IP Whitelisting**: Especially useful for admins or agents. Limit access to specific functionalities (like property listing management) to known IP addresses.
   - **Security Alerts**: Notify users via email/SMS of any suspicious activity, such as logins from a new device or location.
   - **Account Lockout**: Implement account lockout or CAPTCHA after several failed login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.
   
#### 6. **Advanced GDPR Compliance**
   - **Right to Access and Deletion**: Provide a feature where users can request access to their data or request deletion of their account.
   - **Data Anonymization**: When users request deletion, rather than removing all data outright, anonymize key details to maintain analytics and records while complying with GDPR.
   - **Consent Management**: Track and record consent from users for data processing, marketing emails, and other uses.
   - **Cookie Policies**: Integrate a cookie consent banner where users must agree to tracking or analytical cookies.
